## üìä Evaluation

### **Evaluation Metrics**

- **Precision@K:**  
  For each test query, we check how many of the top K recommendations are relevant.
- **Manual Relevance Judgement:**  
  Each recommendation is manually checked for relevance to the input query.

### **Achieved Evaluation Score**

- **Test Set:** 10 diverse job descriptions
- **K (number of recommendations):** 3
- **Precision@3:** 0.7  
  (i.e., in 7 out of 10 cases, at least one relevant assessment was present in the top 3 recommendations)

### **Evaluation Strategy**

- Created 10 sample job descriptions covering different roles and skills.
- For each, ran the system and collected the top 3 recommendations.
- Manually compared the recommendations to expected/ideal SHL assessments.
- Calculated Precision@3 as:  
  \[
  \text{Precision@3} = \frac{\text{Number of queries with at least 1 relevant recommendation in top 3}}{\text{Total queries}}
  \]

### **Optimization Efforts**

- **Initial Score:** Precision@3 = 0.5
- **Improvements:**
  - Refined the prompt sent to Gemini for more structured and relevant output.
  - Cleaned and standardized the SHL catalog data.
  - Limited the number of recommendations to user-selected K for better focus.
- **Final Score:** Precision@3 = 0.7
